     <p>The World Wide Web, or simply the Web, is a global information medium which users can read and write via computers connected to the Internet. The term is often mistakenly used for the Internet itself, but the two are different. The Web is a service that operates over the Internet, just as email does.</p>

     <h2 class="b">WEB TECHNOLOGIES</h2><br><br><br>

     <p>According to Microsoft, web technologies include the following:</p>
     <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right" style="color:black;"></i>  Mark-up languages, such as HTML, CSS, XML, CGI, and HTTP (Front-end or Client-side technologies).<br>
     <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right" style="color:black;"></i> Programming languages and technologies that help create applications for the web. Some of these are Perl, C#, Java,
          Visual Basic, and .NET (Back-end or Server-side technologies).<br>
          <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right" style="color:black;"></i>  Web server and server technologies that enable request handling on a network, where different users have to share 
         the same resources and communicate with each other.<br>
         <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right" style="color:black;"></i> Databases, which are extremely important for data and information storage on a computer network.<br>
         <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right" style="color:black;"></i> Business applications that are customized for specific execution of tasks on a network.<br>
     There are several programming languages and technologies for the Web. Some of the most popular websites,
          ranging from Google to YouTube and from Amazon to twitter are built using these server-side technologies.
The latter include ASP.NET, Java, JavaScript, PERL, Python, PHP, Ruby, and more. We shall discuss the most popular current website technologies in this guide. So, without further ado, let’s begin…
<br><br><BR<><div style="overflow: auto;">The top website technologies:<br><br>
 <ol type="1">
    <li><p style="color:black;"> HTML5</p> If you know this programming language, knowing all the others is a walk in the park.
         This recent addition to the HTML family is very equipped and potent in assisting in web development activities.<br>
    <li><p style="color:black;">  JavaScript</p> This programming language lets you make communication for your website.
         It was developed by Netscape and borrows a lot of its syntax from the C language. 
         Using JavaScript, you can manage your browser, edit content on a document, let client-side scripts interact with users,
          and also enable asynchronous communication. JavaScript is generally used for including animations on web pages, loading new images, 
          scripts or objects onto a web page, and creating extremely receptive user interfaces.<br>
  
     <li><p style="color:black;"> PHP</p> This stands for PHP Hypertext Processor. It is one of the widely-used languages for
          web development and was created in 2004. It is an HTML-embedded scripting language and is useful for creating
           dynamic web pages. Using this language you can expand a web app very quickly. This language has been used to 
           create websites such as WordPress, Digg, and Facebook.<br>
     <li><p style="color:black;"> Python</p>This is an advanced programming language and is used for creating websites and mobile apps.
          It is very flexible and has a broad range of applications. It can run on both Linux and Windows-based servers.
           Some of the sites powered by Python include Instagram and Pinterest, both social media sites.<br>
     <li><p style="color:black;"> Ruby</p> This is a user-friendly language for beginners. It is used for the programming of mobile apps 
         and websites. Created in 1993, Ruby is an open-source platform that is not only easy to understand, but also to write.
          For those who are interested in creating small business software or for those who are into creative designing,
           Ruby is the perfect programming language.<br>
<li><p style="color:black;"> .NET</p> This was created by Microsoft in the year 2000. Though it is used primarily in systems running on Windows,
  this language is used in scientific research and academic fields, thereby more than making up for this feature.<br>
    <li><p style="color:black;">  Perl</p> This is an interpreted script language and presents unique tools for system programming.<br>
    <li> <p style="color:black;"> SQL</p> This stands for Structured Query Language and is a necessary part of web development.
         Using this language, web developers can obtain data from large and multifaceted databases.<br>
